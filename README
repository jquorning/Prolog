This prolog package (which has been hacked about a bit by me to get it working
with comments & blank lines in input files) was originally developed by
the ANNA tools group (ANNotation language for Ada - high powered assertions).

In it's current form it can accept a sequence of prolog facts, which you
can then query.

For example the following series of facts...

    subject  (cs108).
    year     (cs108, 1).
    semester (cs108, 1).

    subject  (cs109).
    year     (cs109, 1).
    semester (cs109, 2).

    subject  (cs208).
    year     (cs208, 2).
    semester (cs208, 1).

    subject  (cs209).
    year     (cs209, 2).
    semester (cs209, 2).

lend themselves to questions such as...

    What subjects were run in 1st year?
    What subjects were run in 2nd semester?

These would be handled by entering a query with an 'unbound'
variable in the place of the missing value. An unbound variable
(not bound to any particular answer) starts with a capital 
letter.

E.g.

What subjects were run in 1st year?
Query   year (X, 1).
Answer  cs108
        cs109


What subjects were run in 2nd semester?
Query   semester (X, 2).
Answer  cs109
        cs209


What semester was cs209 run in?
Query   semester (cs209, X).
Answer  2


What subjects are there?
Query   subject (X).
Answer  cs108
        cs109
        cs208
        cs209


More complex queries can be constructed by creating rules, which
are then queried

What subjects that start in 1st semester are run in 2nd year?
Rule    solution (X) :- semester (X,1), year (X,2).
Query   solution (X).
Answer  cs208

--  Using the program  --
-------------------------

The program

	demo.adb

gives an example of how to use this package.

As well the file

	demo.pro
	course.pro

contain example Prolog programs

Note that the file

	intlibc.pro

is required to be available, and contains various rules that the
packages use to solve queries.

Prolog is a wonderfully powerful language, and this interpreter brings
*some* of that power to you.
